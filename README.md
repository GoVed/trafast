# TraFast

TraFast is a simulation project that models roads and vehicles in a virtual environment. The simulation allows you to create roads, add vehicles to the roads, and observe their movements and interactions.

## Features

- Create and manage roads with different characteristics (length, lanes, speed limits).
- Add vehicles to the roads with specific positions, velocities, and destinations.
- Simulate vehicle movements, acceleration, and deceleration based on road and traffic conditions.
- GUI representation of the roads and vehicles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Make sure you have Rust installed on your system.

The simulation will start, and you will see the GUI representation of the roads and vehicles.

## Usage

To use TraFast, follow these steps:

1. Start the simulation by running `cargo run`.

2. Use the GUI to create roads by specifying the starting and ending points, lanes, and speed limits.

3. Add vehicles to the roads by specifying their positions, velocities, and destinations.

4. Observe the simulation as the vehicles move on the roads, and their interactions with each other based on traffic conditions.
